        <h2> Pea Patch Island, Delaware City, DE </h2>
        <h3> Why should you visit Pea Patch Island? </h3>
            <p> Pea Patch Island is a small island located in the state of Delaware near the enterence into the Delaware Bay. By 1814, the island grew significantly and started the construction of Fort Delaware. Fort Delaware was used during many wars for prisoners of the war. Since this fort has been a major part of history, many enjoy taking a trip to visit this historic site. What some might notice once they arrive is there has been personal paranormal experiences, sometimes even witnessing spooky events as a group. I suggest you take a tip to visit this historic and paranormal site if you would like to enjoy some spooky sites of your own. </p>
        
        <blockquote> "This fort is wonerful to spend the day and learn about the history of the island. Paranormal Adventures in October are FANTASTIC! You want to be a ghost hunter, this is for you! Come see for yourself." </blockquote>
        <blockquote> "We took the ferry from Fort Mott. Fort Delaware was incredible! Lots of history and loved the people in costume. They took their roles seriously. The replica of the Confederate prisoner of war building was impressive. Spent several hours on the boat ride and the tour. Highly recommended!" </blockquote>
        <blockquote> "We had a lot of fun here. It was so interesting and educational for the kids. Very relaxing. Great picnic area to eat lunch." </blockquote>

        <h3> What this location offers </h3>
            <p> Pea Patch Island offers many exciting things to do such as children's parks around the area and it's main focus, Fort Delaware. From the relaxing ferry ride, to the culture and history of Fort Delaware, it is a fantastic place to visit. Not only does the fort have history, but if you like a good scare it's the place to go. The fort offers historic tours from workers dressed like they are from back in the day, and they will inform you on the history of the fort while also adding in some spooky stories along the way. For example, one spooky story is when an entire group of visitors participated in a candlelight ghost tour which featured the darker side of the location. Actresses were preforming a show in the kitchen when a woman came in, gave the workers a nod, and faded into the corner. At first everyone thought she was part of the act until it was noticed that she just faded into the dark and was nowhere to be found after. Fort Delaware is the place to go! </p>
